  Abstract                 = {This article describes a damage identification methodology based on a genetic algorithm and its application to the numerical model of a railway bridge. The identification method is based on an iterative process that in each iteration compares the values of the bridge’s dynamic response for a test damage scenario with the response values for a reference damage scenario. The introduction of damage to the test numerical model is based on the modification of a preselected numerical parameter values. The genetic algorithm allows the identification of damage by minimizing the residue of an objective function constructed from the responses of the test and reference model, and based on the so-called damage indicators. In this study are defined and tested damage indicators based on modal parameters (frequencies and vibration modes) in parameters built from the modal parameters (modal curvatures and flexibility curvatures), and in dynamic responses under action of impulsive loads from frequency response functions (FRFs). The proposed methodology for identifying damage was tested based on a two-dimensional numerical finite element model of a railway bridge including the railway track. The results allowed evaluating the efficiency and reliability of the methodology and of the damage indicators which, in most situations, showed potential in the detection, location and quantification of the severity of the damage.},

  Abstract                 = {The application of structural health monitoring (SHM) systems to civil engineering structures has been a developing studied and practiced topic, that has allowed for a better understanding of structures’ conditions and increasingly lead to a more cost-effective management of those infrastructures. In this field, the use of fiber optic sensors has been studied, discussed and practiced with encouraging results. The possibility of understanding and monitor the distributed behavior of extensive stretches of critical structures it’s an enormous advantage that distributed fiber optic sensing provides to SHM systems. In the past decade, several R & D studies have been performed with the goal of improving the knowledge and developing new techniques associated with the application of distributed optical fiber sensors (DOFS) in order to widen the range of applications of these sensors and also to obtain more correct and reliable data. This paper presents, after a brief introduction to the theoretical background of DOFS, the latest developments related with the improvement of these products by presenting a wide range of laboratory experiments as well as an extended review of their diverse applications in civil engineering structures.},

This article presents the develop- ment of a probabilistic mechanistic modeling approach supported by durability monitoring to obtain improved predictions of service life of concrete bridge decks ex- posed to chlorides. The application and benefits of this approach are illustrated on a case study of a reinforced concrete barrier wall of a highway bridge monitored over 10 years. It is demonstrated that service life predic- tions using probabilistic models calibrated with selected monitored field data can provide more reliable assess- ments of the probabilities of reinforcement corrosion and corrosion-induced damage compared to using determin- istic models based on standard data from the literature. Such calibrated probabilistic models can help decision makers optimize intervention strategies as to how and when to repair or rehabilitate a given structure, thus im- proving its life cycle performance, extending its service life and reducing its life cycle cost.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of modern societies has seen the construction of several structures and infrastructures built in reinforced concrete. The management of those structures, poten- tially large and subjected to important pathologies, aiming at ensuring and guaranteeing their safety and durability has become a true economical challenge. Looking for an optimal inspection, maintenance and repair plan according to safety constraints is one of the pos- sible solutions to address this challenge. This work is bounded by a preventive maintenance context where the concrete degradations may lead to the corrosion of the reinforcements and not to structural failure. The corresponding degradation models are put in an uncer- tainty context where the spatial variability of the environmental exposure and the concrete properties are accounted for. Based on such predictions, an adaptive design of experiments helps to identify, at a given time, where the structure should be inspected in order to eval- uate its degradation state which will indicate the need for maintenance or a repair action. A decision tree therefore allows to predict the probabilistic evolution of the structure state, including the effect of maintenance and repairs. This tree is then used in an optimisation process which aims at finding where and with which inspection technique the structure is to be inspected to minimise both the expectation of the exploitation costs and the associated uncertainties due to the measurement errors, accounting for the stakeholder’s constraints.},

The limit states considered are flexural strength and serviceability. The spatial time-dependent reliability analysis takes into account the uncertainties and variabilities related to material properties, dimensions, loads and corrosion parameters as well as the spatial variability of pitting cor- rosion of prestressing strands. Including the spatial variability of pitting corrosion in the reliability analysis increased both the probability of strength and serviceability failure when compared with a mid-span sectional analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {A time-dependent fatigue reliability assessment approach is proposed for welded details of orthotropic steel decks (OSDs) using long-term strain monitoring data. The fatigue reliability limit function of the welded details is established based on the Eurocode specifications. Depending on the distribution characteristics of the measured daily equivalent stress range, either the lognormal distribution or Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is selected to quantify its uncertainty. Subsequently, the fatigue reliability can be calculated using either an explicit formula or the Monte Carlo method. This proposed approach is applied for the fatigue reliability evaluation of two rib-to-deck and two rib-to-rib welded fatigue details of an in-service suspension bridge. The results show that the reliability indices decrease significantly with bridge’s service life. Except for a rib-to-deck detail, all other three welded details cannot meet the target fatigue reliability during this bridge’s 100-year service life. The proposed approach can help bridge owners and operators make informed decisions regarding maintenance and repair of potential fatigue cracks.},

Since 1994 the responsibility for the management and maintenance of the national roads has rested with the National Roads Authority (NRA). In 2001 the Eirspan bridge management system was introduced to coordinate and integrate activities such as inspections, repairs and rehabilitation work to ensure optimal man- agement of the national road structure stock. This paper summarises the reasons for the introduction of the system and gives a review of the distinct activities included in Eirspan. It describes how bridge components are condition rated within principal inspections and out- lines how, after the completion of the inventory gathering and first principal inspections, repair works are priority ranked. Future developments within Eirspan are also dis- cussed. Eirspan helps engineers within the NRA to prior- itise maintenance needs and maximise the use of available funding. It has proved to be an invaluable tool in helping to maintain the function and safety of bridges throughout the national road network in Ireland.},

  Abstract                 = {Physics‐based models are intensively studied in mechanical and civil engineering but their constant increase in complexity makes them harder to use in a maintenance context, especially when degradation model can/should be updated from new inspection data. On the other hand, Markovian cumulative damage approaches such as Gamma processes seem promising; however, they suffer from lack of acceptability by the civil engineering community due to poor physics considerations. In this article, we want to promote an approach for modeling the degradation of structures and infrastructures for maintenance purposes which can be seen as an intermediate approach between physical models and probabilistic models. A new statistical, data‐driven state‐dependent model is proposed. The construction of the degradation model will be discussed within an application to the cracking of concrete due to chloride‐induced corrosion. Numerical experiments will later be conducted to identify preliminary properties of the model in terms of statistical inferences. An estimation algorithm is proposed to estimate the parameters of the model in cases where databases suffer from irregularities.},

Over recent years the use Weigh-In-Motion technologies has increased hugely. Large Weigh-In-Motion databases are now available for multiple sites on many road networks. The objective of this work is to use data gathered throughout a road network to improve site-specific estimates of bridge loading at a specific Weigh-In-Motion site on the network. Bayesian updating is a mathematical framework for combining prior knowledge with new sample data. The approach is applied here to bridge loading using a database of 81.6 million truck records, gathered at 19 sites in the US. The database represents the prior knowledge of loading throughout the road network and a new site on the network is simulated. The Bayesian approach is compared with a non-Bayesian approach, which uses only the site-specific data, and the results compared. It is found that the Bayesian approach significantly improves the accuracy of estimates of 75-year loading and, in particular, considerably reduces the standard deviation of the error. With the proposed approach less site-specific WIM data is required to obtain an accurate estimate of loading. This is particularly useful where there is concern over an existing bridge and accurate estimates of loading are required as a matter of urgency.},

  Abstract                 = {During the past decade, monitoring concepts for structural systems have been subjected to a rapid development process. They have become more and more important in the intervention planning ͑e.g., maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, replacement͒ on new and existing structures. Nevertheless, there is still a strong need for the efficient use of structural monitoring data in the reliability assessment and prediction models. Updating prediction models, based on monitoring data, affect the intervention strategies. Since these strategies involve costs, monitoring systems assist the efficient spending of available budgets. Therefore, the demand for the efficient use of monitoring data is not only related to structural reliability, but also to cost aspects. In an extended sense, structural monitoring can be considered similar to quality assurance and acceptance sampling, since it is not practically possible to continuously monitor all perfor- mance indicators in all critical sections of an entire structural system. Nevertheless, the continuous and simultaneous measurements at discrete points of a deteriorating structural system, as provided by monitoring, allow the assessment of the performance of a structure with respect to different limit states. The aim of this paper is twofold: ͑a͒ To present an approach for the efficient inclusion of monitoring data in the structural reliability assessment process; and ͑b͒ to demonstrate the use of monitored data for the development of prediction models. The approach is illustrated on an existing highway bridge ͑the Lehigh River Bridge SR-33͒, a structure located in Pennsylvania and monitored by the Advanced Technology for Large Structural Systems Center, a National Engineering Research Center at Lehigh University},

However, due to budget limitations, an optimal methodology to estimate the integrity of a structure at minimum cost is required. This paper presents a spatial optimization of NDT measurements (ultrasound) based on their spatial correlation. The optimization is performed in two steps. First, the relationship between the number of measurements organized in a regular grid and the fitness function value are determined using spatial interpolation (kriging method). Then, using an Optimization Spatial Sampling Method developed for this study (OSSM), the fitness function is minimized by changing the positions of a chosen number of NDT measurements. The theoretical development and the results obtained with both simulated and real data are presented and discussed.},

A major shortcoming in the work carried out to date is the spatial variability and corresponding correlation associated with applied traffic loads. In this paper the influence of spatial correlation of both traffic load and resistance is considered in the con- text of bridge safety assessment. The current study, explores, the nature of the problem by three theoretical examples. As a general trend, examples show that while traffic loads are weakly correlated, load effects are strongly correlated as the same heavy vehicle often causes extremes of load effect in different parts of the bridge which is due to the transverse sharing of load (measured here using a load sharing factor). It is found that the strength of correlation of load effect depends greatly on the load sharing factor which is treated in a simple way in many studies. In a more sophisticated beam-and-slab bridge example, load sharing factors are derived from a finite element analysis to assess transverse load sharing, and are shown to vary by girder number, girder segment and by load location. Despite the fact that load effect at points along the length of a bridge is strongly correlated, the combined influence of correlation in load and resistance on probability of failure is small.},

BRIDGIT was developed under the AASHTO-sponsored National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP Projects 12-28(2) A,B and C) and is a multi-user PC-based system that is user-friendly, easy to implement, and satisfies all of the FHWA requirements for BMS. BRIDGIT uses a project-level-based optimization strategy to provide network- level recommendations. BRIDGIT provides guidance on how best to allocate funds on your bridge network, thus optimizing network performance. It also recommends specific actions for each bridge, consistent with overall network strategy. This is done by considering the costs and benefits of many possible actions on every bridge. BRIDGIT can quickly handle bridge inventories of hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of bridges. BRIDGIT is able to quickly handle various “What If?” funding scenarios, providing the user with the immediate feedback desirable in the budgeting and programming process. Additionally, with project-level recommendations and its own maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation (MR&R) module, BRIDGIT is useful to all areas in the bridge office, from network budgeting and programming to project selection to bridge maintenance cost tracking.},

  Abstract                 = {Monitoring deflections provides a powerful diagnostic tool for structural health monitoring of bridges. Excessive deflections under service loads may be indicative of structural changes, damage and deteriora- tion. For the real time monitoring of deflections under operating traffic loads, it is often difficult to estab- lish a fixed reference point for displacement transducers either because the bridge crosses over a body of water or a roadway. Moreover, vandalism and environmental conditions disrupt and more than likely alter the fixity of the reference points. The work presented in this study pertains to the development of a method for real time remote monitoring of bridge deflections. From the practical point of view, the primary attribute of the proposed method is its capability for making reference free estimates of bridge deflections. The formulations employ the measured rotations and curvatures of the bridge for this purpose. The feasibility of the approach was tested on two different highway bridges. Both bridges were instrumented with a number of different fiber optic sensors that included tiltmeters and strain gauges. Conventional transducers and displacement measurement devices were also used in parallel in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. A series of load tests were conducted at both bridge sites that included use of trucks with known weights. In addition, finite element models were developed and employed for further verification of the proposed approach. Field test measurement results and their correlations with the conventional methods as well as comparison with the finite element models are described in this article.},

However, it is inconvenient to obtain the bridge deflections directly. For bridges over rivers, railways, or highways, a direct measurement method is impractical. A promising bridge deflection measurement method ͑inclinometer method͒ is presented in this paper. It offers a simple, practical and inexpensive method of measuring static and dynamic deflections of bridge spans under loads, even for bridge spans that traverse great heights. Hundreds of experiments and practical tests on simple and continuous bridges, utilizing dynamic and static loads, under various vehicle speeds, show that the method has very high precision, which provides an authentic basis for new-built bridge acceptance and old bridge safety evaluation. The method does not need fixed observation positions as other deflection measurement methods because the inclinometers are installed on the bridge directly, which increases measurement efficiency greatly. These features indicate that as a potential method of measuring bridge deflection, inclinometers have significant engineering application value and a promising future.},

  Abstract                 = {The successful past performance of an existing bridge is evidence of its resistance, which reduces the uncertainty associated with the resistance and so increases the bridge reliability. However, the resistance deterioration and increases in traffic load may negate this effect. In this paper, statistical techniques are used to combine the prior estimate of time-dependent resistance with new information from the service load history, thereby obtaining an updated estimate of bridge resistance, as well as an updated reliability for subsequent years. The application of the method is illustrated using an existing bridge. The influences of the intensity and nonstationarity of service load history and the shape and variance of deterioration function on updated estimates of bridge resistance and reliability are examined using parametric examples. It is found that the updated resistance of an existing bridge with ever-increasing traffic load is close to that of the same bridge with a stationary traffic load process if the load intensities at the latest stage of the two-load process are identical; however, the updated reliability of the bridge is greatly reduced considering the increase of traffic load with time. The statistics of the deterioration function has a significant effect on both the updated resistance and reliability of the bridge, while the shape of the deterioration function has a significant effect on the updated reliability only. The estimate of initial bridge resistance can also be updated by the proposed method, but the updating effect is insignificant compared with the updating of current resistance.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a generic degradation model based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) which predicts the condition of a technical system. Besides handling bi-directional reasoning, a major benefit of this degradation model using a DBN is its ability to adequately model stochastic processes as well as Markov chains. We will assume that the behavior of the degradation can be represented as a P–F-curve (also called degradation or life curve). The model developed here is able to combine information from expert knowledge, any kind of sensor and operating data as well as information from the machine operator. Using the Bayesian approach, uncertain knowledge can be handled appropriately. Thus it is even possible to take into account the environment and stress under which the component or system is operating. Hence, it is possible to detect potential failures at an early stage and initiate appropriate remedy and repair strategies prior to catastrophic failure.},

  Abstract                 = {A probabilistic prediction framework of corrosion-induced strength degradation for flexural beams is proposed in this paper. The proposed framework considers both ductile and brittle failure modes of rein- forcements. The area loss of steel bars is established considering the likelihood of corrosion types. Statis- tical data analysis is used to quantify the uncertainties of capacity variation of corroded reinforcing bars based on the experimental investigation of tensile tests of 452 corroded reinforcements from different members. Following this, the static tests on 48 beams are conducted, and the finite element method (FEM) is used to evaluate the effects of corrosion on carrying capacity. A probabilistic model to include the effect of inaccurate modeling of corrosion on the beam bearing capacity is developed. Area loss and strength degradation of corroded reinforcing bar, possible ductile and brittle failure of reinforcement and model uncertainty are incorporated into analysis of time-dependent strength degradation. Finally, a Bayesian updating methodology is proposed to update the prior belief of the uncertainties and the updated posterior distributions are used for probabilistic prediction using field inspection results. Three beams demolished from a 36-year old concrete bridge are used to demonstrate and to validate the overall procedure. The prediction combined with Bayesian updating provides a satisfactory result by comparing model predictions with realistic field inspection.},

  Abstract                 = {The reliability of reinforced concrete (RC) bridge decks depends significantly on the rate of corrosion of the reinforcing steel. Structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques, including embedded corrosion rate sensors, can greatly improve the quantification of the steel corrosion rate, which can lead to improved estimates of structural safety and serviceability. Due to uncertainties in concrete properties, environmental conditions, and other factors, the rate of corrosion of reinforcing steel can be highly variable, both within a given structural component and over time. By placing multiple corrosion rate sensors throughout a structural component, such as a bridge deck, these spatial and temporal variabilities can be monitored and as such better predicted, for use in a reliability model. The objective of this investigation is to present a reliability model for a RC bridge deck incorporating both spatial and temporal variations of probabilistic corrosion rate sensor data. This objective is accomplished using a computational reliability model and Monte Carlo simulation. Corrosion rate sensor data is assumed for multiple critical sections throughout a RC bridge deck over time by applying empirical spatial and temporal relationships. This data is then used to improve an existing spatially invariant reliability model. The improved reliability model incorporates several sub-models to determine the changes in load effects on and resistance of a RC bridge deck slab over time, as well as spatial correlation of corrosion and a system approach to account for spatial variability. The improved reliability model incorporating both spatial and temporal variations in corrosion rate data provides a better estimate of the service life of a RC bridge deck slab.},

American standard load model is considered, which is increasing in time and a RC slab model for the resistance. The resistance model accounts for deterioration through cloride ingress and thus corrosion initation and corrosion process in the rebars. The probability of failure (of the critical cross-section) is then calculated for each year on a 50 years time horizon. After this, data is gathered using hypotetical corrosion rate measures placed on the girders of the bridge. With the help of this data, spatial and temporal variability of corrosion rate (hence actual area of reinforcement) can be accounted for in the model. Also both general and pitting corrosion are studied separately and compared later. The hyptothetical data is assumed to be spatially a) perfectly positively correlated, b) at a level positively correlated, c) fully independent. In this improved model also system reliability is introduced, meaning that the failure of the structure occurs if failure occurs in three adjacent section of the bridge.},

Intervention scheduling is defined, ensuring that the railway track remains of good quality with a high probability.

  Abstract                 = {Visual Inspection is the predominant nondestructive evaluation technique used in bridge inspections. However, since implementation of the National Bridge Inspection Standards in 1971, a comprehensive study of the reliability of Visual Inspection as it relates to highway bridge inspections has not been conducted. The goals of the study include: providing overall measures of the accuracy and reliability of Routine and In-Depth Visual Inspections, studying the influence of several key factors that affect Routine and In-Depth Inspections, and studying the differences between State inspection procedures and reports. Ten inspection tasks were performed at seven test bridges using State bridge inspectors. The sample of participating inspectors included 49 inspectors from 25 State agencies. Inspectors were provided with common information, instruction, and tools. Inspector characteristics were measured through self-report questionnaires, interviews, and direct measurements. Routine Inspections were completed with significant variability, and the Condition Ratings assigned varied over a range of up to five different ratings. It is predicted that only 68 percent of the Condition Ratings will vary within one rating point of the average, and 95 percent will vary within two points. Factors that appeared to correlate with Routine Inspection results include Fear of Traffic; Visual Acuity and Color Vision; Light Intensity; Inspector Rushed Level; and perceptions of Maintenance, Complexity, and Accessibility. In-Depth Inspections using Visual Inspection alone are not likely to detect or identify the specific types of defects for which the inspection is prescribed, and may not reveal deficiencies beyond those that could be noted during a Routine Inspection. The overall thoroughness with which inspectors completed one of the In-Depth tasks tended to have an impact on the likelihood of an inspector detecting weld crack indications. Other factors that may be related to In-Depth Inspection accuracy include: time to complete inspection, comfort with access equipment and heights, structure complexity and accessibility, viewing of welds, flashlight use, and number of annual inspections performed. The State procedural and reporting tasks indicated that most States follow similar procedural and reporting criteria. Several inconsistencies were noted with the use of the element-level inspection systems, but it is not known if these variations are the result of State practices or inspector use. Deck delamination surveys were found to have significant variability, with only a few teams performing a delamination survey as part of the Routine Inspection.

A second cam- era is used to monitor traffic and to determine axle spacings. The two cameras are synchronized using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) activated by an interval timer. The exact position of the test vehicle relative to the bridge influence line is determined by optimization at a postprocessing stage. The new WIM concept was tested on a bridge in the United Kingdom. In a modest test sample of eight statically weighed vehicles, cBWIM was shown to be a feasible alternative to other forms of WIM. Accuracy of gross weight is already reasonably good; accuracy of groups and individual axles will require greater magnification or additional cameras.},

  Abstract                 = {Composite bridge decks provide higher flexural moment capacity and stiffness compared to their non-composite counterparts. In order to achieve composite behavior, differential slip between the steel member and the concrete slab must be restrained by means of shear connectors. In older bridge decks composite behavior is uncertain. Uncertainty arises, among other things, due to lack of knowledge regarding the type of shear connector used (if any), cumulative damage due to fatigue, and aging effects. In this paper the authors propose the use of sensitivity-based finite element model updating to determine the degree of composite behavior of operational bridge decks with uncertain shear connectors. The free parameters of the models are: rigidity per unit length of the beam-slab interface and the elastic modulus of the concrete slab. The features used in the model updating procedure are the identified modal frequen- cies from operational acceleration measurements. A sequential sensitivity-based weighted least-squares solution was implemented. The proposed methodology is verified in various simulated bridge deck struc- tures and validated in an operational and partially instrumented bridge deck with uncertain composite action.},

As a result, the implications of introducing proactive health monitoring can be assessed using probabilistic durability criteria. Thus, the second objective of the paper is to present a methodology for performance updating of deteriorating concrete bridges fitted with a proactive health monitoring system. This methodology is illustrated via a simple example of a typical bridge element, such as a beam or a part of a slab. The results highlight the benefits from introducing ‘smart’ technology in managing bridges subject to deterioration, and quantify the reduction in uncertainties and their subsequent effect on predictions of future bridge performance.},

The condition of elements within the selected sample of bridges and a set of conditional probabilities for static and time dependent variables, based on inspection experience, are used as input to the models to yield, in probabilistic terms, overall condition-based deterioration profiles for bridge groups. Sensitivity towards various input parameters, as well as underlying assumptions, on the point-in-time performance and the deterioration profile of the group are investigated.

  Abstract                 = {This article describes the development of a non-contact dynamic displacement measurement system for railway bridges based on video technology. The system, consisting of a high speed video camera, an opti- cal lens, lighting lamps and a precision target, can perform measurements with acquisition frame rates ranging from 64 fps to 500 fps, and be articulated with other measurement systems, which promotes its integration in structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Preliminary tests of the system have shown that the measurements’ precision can be affected by: (i) movements of the camera stand and, therefore, rigid supports should be used and the camera should be protected from air flows; (ii) the dis- tortion of the field of view, caused by the flow of heat waves generated by IR incandescent lighting and, therefore, the operating time of the lamps should be limited. The system was used to measure the dis- placement of a railway bridge’s deck, induced by the passage of trains at speeds between 120 km/h and 180 km/h, yielding a very good agreement between the results of displacement measurement obtained with the video system and with a LVDT. The achieved precision was below 0.1 mm for distances from the camera to the target up to 15 m, and in the order of 0.25 mm for a distance of 25 m. The appli- cation of an image processing technique at subpixel level resulted in real precisions generally inferior to the theoretical precisions.},

  Abstract                 = {Bridges are inspected, regularly or otherwise, for fatigue cracks using a variety of different methods. However, for all of these methods, inspection does not necessarily imply detection due to a number of factors including the inspector’s experience and the physically inherent limitations of the method. Consequently, traditional inspection methods do not have a limitless capacity for crack detection. As fatigue is a phenomenon involving crack growth over time, application of a particular method will have a time-dependent probability of detecting a crack. In this paper, crack growth, as this may be observed in a typical bridge fatigue detail, is quantified using fracture mechanics and the performance of four different inspection methods over time is compared in terms of their probability of detection. Although the results presented here are pertinent to the particular type of bridge detail and loading conditions, fracture mechanics may also be applied to a wide variety of different details in order to compare detection capabilities at different time instances.},

  Abstract                 = {A probabilistic methodology for the safety assessment of short span railway bridges for high-speed traffic is presented. The purpose is to create a simple, efficient and automatic procedure that allows identifying the critical train speeds over the bridge and assessing the safety of the train–bridge system. The method- ology combines simulation techniques with the extreme value theory in order to minimise the required computational time and guarantee accurate results. Stochastic simulation is employed as it allows reflecting the real variability of the parameters that characterise the dynamic response of the train– bridge system. As a case study the safety of a short span filler beam railway bridge crossed by a TGV dou- ble train is assessed. The behaviour of short span railway bridges is known to be particularly difficult to predict due to the complexity of the coupled train–track–bridge system, as well as for being particularly sensitive to resonant phenomena. The variability of the bridge, the track and the train was accounted for, as well as the existence of track irregularities. The proposed probabilistic methodology proved to be effi- cient as it allowed identifying the critical train speeds with a reduced computational cost. Furthermore, for these critical train speeds two different methods were used to estimate the probability of failure. The obtained results showed a good agreement guaranteeing the accuracy of the methodology.},

The Project Level BMS, which deals primarily with individual bridges, uses the recommendations and goals from the network level to decide on the repair measures in individual repair projects to create repair and reconstruction programmes. The project level system is the key tool for everyday bridge repair planning in the road districts. The system helps the bridge engineer to plan and schedule the repair projects for individual bridges based on the recommendations and the damage data in the database. The system works with repair and reconstruction programmes. In connection to these programmes different alternative studies and profitability calculations can be made. For example, analyses concerning bridge structural parts and bridges remnant life will be available. A ranking system is used when picking out the bridges which need either repair and rehabilitation or reconstruction measures. An index describing the repair needs of individual bridges was taken in use for the purpose of arranging the bridges in an urgency order in the work programme. This repair index is a function of a bridge structural part’s estimated condition, damage class and the repair urgency class. The programme is prepared so that the condition target can be reached by following the given repair recommendations.},

  Abstract                 = {Characterization of randomness and spatial variability of material properties, loading or deterioration processes of structures, from inspection, is a very challenging task that concentrates the improvement of Non Destructive Testing (NDT) tools on more efficient and higher structural coverage. In case of characterization of random loading or material properties, this challenge is arduous because of the limited number of measures and the quasi-infinite potential positions of local failures. This paper presents a two stages procedure for the stochastic characterization of random fields from NDT measurements. According to the stationarity property, the optimal quantity of NDT measurements and their position can be assessed once a quality requirement is included. The proposed procedure allows: (i) to quantify the properties of the ergodic stationary field, and (ii) to assess the second order parameters of the studied random variables. The paper ends illustrating the methodology with an application that considers the inspection of a concrete beam with a capacitive technique. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is useful to identify the parameters of a random field by reducing the number of NDT measures under given quality requirements.},

The structure considered herein is a singly reinforced RC beam with Y16 or Y27 reinforcing bars. Experimental data obtained from corrosion tests are used to characterise the probability distribution of pit depth. The RC beam is discretised into a series of small elements and maximum pit depths are generated for each reinforcing steel bar in each element. The loss of cross-sectional area, reduction in yield strength and reduction in flexural resistance are then inferred. The analysis considers various member spans, loading ratios, bar diameters and numbers of bars in a given cross-section, and moment diagrams. It was found that the maximum corrosion loss in a reinforcing bar conditional on beam collapse was no more than 16\%. The probabilities of failure considering spatial variability of pitting corrosion were up to 200\% higher than probabilities of failure obtained from a non-spatial analysis after 50 years of corrosion. This shows the importance of considering spatial variability in a structural reliability analysis for deteriorating structures, particularly for corroding RC beams in flexure.},

Experimental studies: two RC beam specimens with differnt diamaters are tested for accelerated corrosion. Pit depth data are then examined statistically. Spatial variability of pits is also studied. It is conssidered that corrosion affect also the yield strength of the reiforcement. However the effect of corrosion on the reduction of bond is not considered. Reinforcement is assumed to fail by yielding (ductile failure mode). Capacity of each emement is taken at the cross-section of the middle of teh element as the deepest pit is assumed to occur in the middle of the element. Elements shall be 100 mm or less long. Ultimate flexural capacity is assumed to be near-linearly proportional to f.y * A.st, i.e. yielding capacity of reinforcement. Case study: RC floor beams in flexure M.u/M.nom is modeled as a lognormal distribution Dead load, live load and extraordinary live load are considered. It's a comparative study, lacking absolute sense!!! (many variables are modeled deterministically) Results: The analysis assumes statistical independence between teh pitting factor for each element and between each reinforcing bar within the element. Still NOT considering spatial correlation!!! Spatial vs. non-spatial analysis = considering only the midspan element vs. considering all elements and choosing the critical after. Effect of pitting corrosion is more detrimental fro smaller diameter bars. At the end of the paper a statistical analysis of flexural resistance and corrosion loss are presented. Spatially analysis gives much higher probabilities of failure. Structural reliability also reduces as member span increases and as number of reinforcement decreases. The reduction in yield stress significantly reduces structural reliability.},

  Abstract                 = {Bridges deteriorate with time due to aggressive environments and are subject to ever-increasing traffic loads. This results in reduction of their reliability, which may eventually fall below an acceptable level. A successful proof load reduces the uncertainty associated with resistance of the bridge and so increases its reliability. Also, if a bridge has survived for T years of service, its resistance is higher than any of the prior imposed loads and so is influenced by its load history. Thus, the reliability of service-proven (i.e., older) bridges would increase. However, the influence of deterioration and increases in traffic loads may negate this expected increase. The paper considers the effects of load history (proof loads and prior service loads) on the reliability of aging bridges. The influence of bridge age and the magnitude of proof loads on updated estimates of bridge reliability is examined. It was found that proof load testing may not be cost effective if the costs of bridge failure (unsuccessful test) and the test itself are considered in a preliminary risk-cost-benefit analysis. The influence of prior service loads on the reliability of existing bridges significantly increased annual bridge reli- abilities. The reliability-based approach presented in the paper provides an improved decision-making framework for the assessment of aging bridges.},

The uncertainties of predictions can be reduced by the effective use of information obtained from visual inspections regarding structural performance, such as cracking proportion and crack width. The paper uses a spatial time-dependent reliability analysis combined with visual inspection data to predict the likelihood and extent of RC corrosion-induced cracking. In this study, RC slabs and beams are used to illustrate the influence of inspection information updating on the future likelihood and extent of corrosion-induced cracking. Concrete strength, concrete cover and the surface chloride concentrations are modelled as spatial variables. Monte-Carlo simulation is employed to calculate the updated cracking proportions. The analysis considers various inspection scenarios which include different inspection intervals, inspection times, cracking proportion and crack width. It was found that the occurrence or observance of cracking changes the future cracking prediction significantly.},

The outputs of the study are inspection configurations (in space and time) that could provide an optimal balance between accuracy and cost.

  Abstract                 = {his paper presents several aspects of a method for reliability assessment of reinforced concrete (RC) slab bridges with corroded reinforcement. It is assumed that corrosion will lead to a reduction in cross-sectional area of the reinforcing steel and/or a reduction in bond strength. Two types of corrosion are considered: general and localized corrosion. The method includes a non-linear finite element structural model and probabilistic models for traffic loads, corrosion propagation, bond characteristics, material properties, element dimensions and reinforcement placement. Reliability is estimated in terms of the reliability index using the first-order reliability method (FORM). For illustrative purposes, bridge reliabilities are calculated for a deteriorating, simple-span RC slab bridge, for ultimate strength and serviceability limit states.},

  Review                   = {A reliability analysis method is performed. General and pitting corrosion are taken into account (separately), but NOT their spatial variability!!! Also the bonding loss is considered for general corrosion. ULS (flexural failure) and SLS (deflection) are bothe studied. Dead load is treated as normal random variable. Traffic load : static and dynamic component. Load distribution amonge axles and axle gaps are taken acc. to HS20 truck. Structural model: 2D FEM fro slab bridges. Reliability analysis made based on the use of FORM. Spatial variation of material properties are NOT accounted for. Case study ULS : Pitting corrosion ( bottom reinforcement in the middle part of the slab is corroding) is in general more hazardous, but general corrosion (number of affected bars is gradually increasing and reaches all after 60 years) is dangerous due to the loss of bonding. SLS : General corrosion leads to greater loss of bridge reliability due to the loss of bond strength. Area loss of reinforcement has insignificant effect on SLS (what a surprise :P) Further research : appropriate model for tension stiffening! spatial variation of bond characteristics, localized corrosiona nd other materials behaviour properties more realistic structural load and system modelling influence of mix design, environmental conditions,a dn workmanship on corrosion initiation and other materials behaviour models},

  Abstract                 = {A structural deterioration reliability (probabilistic) model has been used herein to calculate probabilities of structural failure. New reinforced concrete corrosion initiation, corrosion rate and time-variant load models are proposed. Three durability design speci®cations are considered in a lifetime reliability analysis of a RC slab bridge. Time-variant increases in loads are considered also. It was found that the application of de-icing salts causes signi®cant long-term deterioration and reduction in structural safety for poor dur- ability design speci®cations. A reduced cover or increased water-cement ratio increases failure prob- abilities. When compared to the case of ``no deterioration'', it was observed also that the probability of failure only marginally increased for good durability design speci®cations. The approaches described herein are relevant to other physical infrastructure also.},

The original plan, devised in the late 1980s, envisaged installation and management of low cost traffic data collection systems by highway agencies at approximately 2,500 LTPP tests sites. This plan proved unachievable and a revised plan was implemented to collect research-quality traffic data from a much smaller number of LTPP test sites. The revised plan has generated the largest repository of high-quality traffic data ever collected. This paper gives a brief history of traffic data collection for the LTPP program; describes the technical details of the revised traffic data collection plan and the novel financing and contracting arrangements; and summarizes the results.},

In this paper, the reliability and practicability of using high-rate carrier phase global posi- tioning system (GPS) receivers are investigated to characterize dynamic oscillations of bridges. Initially, the short baseline trial is conducted to study the precision and character- istics of such kind of receivers as well as the potential applications of such a high-frequency data rate. After that, the performance of high-rate GPS receivers for dynamic response tracking is validated against accelerometers through controlled experimental tests and a novel kind of wavelet packet-based filtering method is also proposed. Finally, on-site dynamic experiments are carried out to measure the bridge deck oscillation induced by dif- ferent external loads. Observed data are compared with predicted values derived from modeling undertaken with the finite element (FE) analysis software. The results of all the experiments proved to be very encouraging, and showed that high-rate GPS receiver is successful in quantifying both environmental induced bridge vibrations and high-fre- quency transient motion caused by vehicle loading, providing the ability for verification and/or improvement of structural design and modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {The knowledge of the process of the deterioration of structural resistance is crucial for existing bridge assessment. However, precisely modeling the process of loading also affects the evaluation. Indeed traffic loading is one of the main loads that a bridge is subjected to in its service time. This paper investigates the role of traffic loading on the time-dependent reliability of a given bridge. Emphasis is placed on updating traffic load effect models with consideration of traffic evolution due to traffic growth, change of traffic com- position and modification of the weight limit regulation. Moreover, loss of resistance due to chloride induced corrosion is taken in account. Finally, the annual reliability is evaluated to quantify the influence of traffic evolution on the reliability of a reinforced concrete bridge.},
